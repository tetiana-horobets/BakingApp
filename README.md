## BakingApp
BakingApp is the project which I made from scratch for [Android Developer Nanodegree Program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). The app takes recipes in JSON format from the web and shows ingredients, steps and videos. 
 
### Learning Outcomes

* managing activity and fragment lifecycle
* passing data between activities and fragments
* using Exoplayer to display videos
* creating Android Widget
* designing layouts for different screen sizes (phones and tablets) and orientation (portrait and landscape)
* loading and caching data from network 
* JSON parsing and serialization
* testing with Espresso Tests
